        <h4 class="underlined">Case study</h4>
        <p>
            Scenario: business of your client is based on several web applications, all written in Angular.
            Each application will be different, but
            they could reuse a common mechanism - for example authentication, authorisation, metrics and so on. What's
            important - they do not necessary have to use all of it, they might want to overwrite a single common
            mechanism, but still have other mechanisms in place. The client was clear about
            the requirements: <span class="quotation">"We want you to build one shareable library, that will be reused
            by each of our web applications."</span>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4 class="underlined">The problem</h4>
        <p>
            Let's be clear - each application will differ from the others. Business requirements might change over the
            time.
            At the beginning it might look like the web applications are similar - but after couple of weeks/months of
            development we might
            face problems, where shareable library is <strong>limiting</strong> us. We would not like a situation, where
            our application needs changes, the shareable library is blocking us to implement them and the only way out
            are some dirty hacks.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4 class="underlined">The solution</h4>
        <p>
            The answer is <strong>polymorphism</strong>. Shareable library might contain some complex mechanism - where
            dependency tree is
            nested and quite complicated, but with polymorphism we will be able to alter each
            <span style="color: yellow">@Injectable()</span> provider. We may want to use default provider from
            shareable library,
            we may also totally change the implementation of provider, or we might want to extend existing
            implementation - each web application will do what suits it best.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4 class="underlined">How it works</h4>
        <p>
            There are at least two paths to achieve polymorphism:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on Abstract Classes</li>
            <li>Based on Interfaces with InjectionTokens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this example we I'll use Interfaces with InjectionTokens, as it's better and recommended tool to use in
            polymorphism (more in that matter in following sections).
            First we're gonna define our interface - just simple Animal interface, with one method to implement:
        </p>
        <pre><code [highlight]="howItWorks.interface"></code></pre>
        <p>
            Let's implement the Animal interface:
        </p>
        <pre><code [highlight]="howItWorks.implementation"></code></pre>
        <p>
            There needs to be a place, where we will tell our application, that it should use that particular
            implementation when such an interface is injected. To achieve it we need to define InjectionToken:
        </p>
        <pre><code [highlight]="howItWorks.token"></code></pre>
        <p>
            Finally to make our example work we will add the instruction inside Angular module:
        </p>
        <pre><code [highlight]="howItWorks.provideAndUseClass"></code></pre>
        <p>
            That's pretty much it - in following part we are gonna nail the Shareable library example.
        </p>

        <h4 class="underlined">Example of polymorphism in real application</h4>
        <section class="sub-element">
            <h5 class="underlined">Shareable library</h5>
            <p>
                The shareable library is really simple - it offers two small services:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    UserContextService - responsible for accessing the user's data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    AuthenticationService - responsible for authenticating the user.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The dependency between the services is shown below (UserContextService has dependency of
                AuthenticationService):
            </p>
            <!--tutaj moze (i powinno) być więcej dependecy. Głównie z uwagi na to, ze jezeli UserContextService nie -->
            <!--zależy od niczego innego, to ten przykład nie ma sensu-->
            <div class="shareable-library-diagram-image blog-article-image"></div>
            <p>
                In order to start the example let's define interfaces and injection tokens of the two services:
            </p>
            <p>
                AuthenticationService:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="shareableLibrary.authenticationService"></code></pre>
            <p>
                UserContextService:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="shareableLibrary.userContextService"></code></pre>
            <p>
                Tokens:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="shareableLibrary.tokens"></code></pre>
            <p>
                As it was described in one of the first paragraphs - Shareable library should give it's consumers a
                default implementation of it's interfaces - in real world scenario that is not really necessary, but
                let's follow our business requirements and write down the defaults:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="shareableLibrary.defaultAuthenticationService"></code></pre>
            <pre><code [highlight]="shareableLibrary.defaultUserContextService"></code></pre>
            <p>
                Shareable library should also give it's consumers an instruction, that would bind tokens with it's
                default
                implementation. If web application is not overriding them - the defaults from shareable library are
                used.
                But if web app wants to override any of them - it's free to do it. And that's beautiful.

        <section class="sub-element">
            <h5 class="underlined">Web application - No.1</h5>
            <p>Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use default implementation of AuthenticationService.</li>
                <li>Use default implementation of UserContextService.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <p>We don't need anything fancy here - so the easiest solution is just import the library module:</p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp1.appModule"></code></pre>
        </section>
        <section class="sub-element">
            <h5 class="underlined">Web application - No.2</h5>
            <p>Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use default implementation of AuthenticationService.</li>
                <li>
                    Default implementation of UserContextService does not meet requirements of this web application.
                    We are forced to totally reimplement UserContextService - and introduce CustomUserContextService.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Solution</p>
            <p>
                AuthenticationService with it's default implementation suites us, but default UserContextService has to
                be
                totally overwritten. We need to define another service, that implements UserContextService interface -
                once that is achieved we will be able to tell our app, that it should use our CustomUserContextService
                in every place, where UserContextService is required:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp2.customUserContextService"></code></pre>
            <p>
                Finally we need to instruct our web application how to resolve dependencies. We are basically defining
                that the application should add all dependencies from SharableModule to the Angular context, but
                overwrite the one that does not suit the business requirements:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp2.appModule"></code></pre>
        </section>
        <section class="sub-element">
            <h5 class="underlined">Web application - No.3</h5>
            <p>Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AuthenticationService needs to be overwritten by CustomAuthenticationService, that serves data
                    specific only to this web application.
                </li>
                <li>Use default implementation of UserContextService.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <p>
                The case in this web application is pretty much same as in the above example - but right now we will be
                changing the perception of DefaultUserContextService (which resides inside Shareable library). We are
                gonna tell the UserContextService implementation that it should not take DefaultAuthenticationService,
                but our CustomAuthenticationService instead. This example shows that we can change each small brick,
                that resides inside Shareable library nested dependency tree.
            </p>
            <p>Let's implement CustomAuthenticationServie:</p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp3.customAuthenticationService"></code></pre>
            <p>Same as above, we need to instruct our application, that certain dependency should be overwritten:</p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp3.appModule"></code></pre>
            <p>
                With that implemented, the DefaultUserContextService from Shareable library will pick
                CustomAuthenticationService straight from our web app.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="sub-element">
            <h5 class="underlined">Web application - No.4</h5>
            <p>Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Default implementation of AuthenticationService is quite good, but have to add couple of bits to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will use default implementation of UserContextService, but it needs to be enriched, to meet our
                    expectations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <p>
                Most probably this case will be the commonly used one. It might be unlikely situation that we will be
                forced to totally change the behavior of default services. Instead of it we might want to somehow enrich
                the base behavior with our custom inset. To achieve that we will use composition design technique (more
                about composition can be found
                <a href="https://www.journaldev.com/1325/composition-in-java-example" target="_blank">here</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's define AuthenticationWithCompositionService and UserContextWithCompositionService. Both are
                implementing interfaces from Shareable library:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp4.authenticationWithCompositionService"></code></pre>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp4.userContextWithCompositionService"></code></pre>
            <p>
                As we can see - DefaultAuthenticationService and DefaultUserContextService were used to provide
                composition. Let's define dependencies in the module:
            </p>
            <pre><code [highlight]="webApp4.appModule"></code></pre>

        <h4 class="underlined">Conclusions</h4>
        <p>
            Shareable library is much more powerful, when we pull polymorphism into our design. As every pattern, it
            has it's advantages and drawbacks. Lets list them out.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Really high flexibility while using Shareable library. It won't limit us anymore, we won't stuck with
                it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ability to reimplement leafs in dependency tree, event those sitting deep, deep down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shareable library may not define default implementation for a service on purpose, giving bright
                signal for it's consumers that there is a dependency, that should be fully customized - example could
                be a service that holds some environment data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Drawbacks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Shareable library is exporting interfaces, and each web application is allowed to implement them. Due
                to that we have to define interfaces in much more sensible way to avoid (as much as possible)
                any changes. If there is strong need for an adjustment, we have to assume that it will be a breaking
                change for (at least one) web application
                - we have to update the version of our library, to alert consumers that there was an adjustment
                done - for example upgrade from version 1.2.10 to 2.0.0, (more about versioning can be found
                <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">here</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
                We will be forced to write a little more code than we would without polymorphism.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to instruct our application to use a custom implementation of some interface, we have to put
                a definition in module. That approach is not explicit, it's implicit and for developers not familiar
                with it it will look magically.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="underlined">Why favor interfaces over abstract classes</h4>
        <p>
            Abstract classes in dependency injection may look like better solution. With interfaces we have to define
            two elements: Interface and InjectionToken, where for abstract classes only one (only the abstract class).
            But there are three big disadvantages of abstract classes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It's possible for abstract class to have non-abstract, implemented methods. Each class that extends
                abstract class (and is used as dependency) is contaminated with non-abstract methods. We may agree
                internally that we won't define any non-abstract methods, but we cannot be 100% sure that it won't
                ever happen. One would say that we always can implement (instead of extending) abstract classes, so
                non-abstract methods won't be taken into account. But still - this requirement can be easily broken by
                any developer that use 'extends' instead of 'implements' in any place.
                On the other hand interfaces can not have any methods implemented, so the problem does not occur.
                Developer is forced to implement each method in interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's possible for abstract classes to hold state (private, public or protected, static or nonstatic
                fields that are holdings values). Each class extending abstract class would be contaminated with
                the state.
            </li>
            <li>
                Solution with abstract classes is even more implicit than the one with interfaces. Taking a deeper
                look on shareable library - InjectionTokens are explicitly defined and used in constructors.
                Developer instantly knows, that this particular dependency may be overwritten, and that there exist
                an implementation for an interface used in InjectionToken. On the other hand we can have abstract class
                with a state, 1 abstract method and 3 non-abstract methods. It may not be obvious that there exists
                another class in the air, that will be used instead of the one that that developer is looking on right
                now.
            </li>
        </ul>
